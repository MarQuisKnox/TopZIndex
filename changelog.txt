____________________________
Version 1.2 (2010-10-21)
	
	Changed default selector back to "*" from "body *". Internally, the element selection was re-worked to use the browser's native document.getElementsByTagName("*") if all elements are to be selected, as this will perform better than creating a jQuery instance, regardless of the default selector used.
	
	Worked around a bug in WebKit browsers that returns scientific notation (instead of an integer value) for large z-index values. For example, Safari for Windows returns 1e+006 instead of 1000000 (1 million).
	
	Slight performance increase through setting the z-index style on elements using the native DOM style property of each element, rather than generating a jQuery matched set for each element and using .css("z-index", ___).
